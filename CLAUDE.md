# Mokumo — CLAUDE.md

Production management software for decorated apparel shops. Full garment lifecycle:
Quote → Artwork Approval → Production → Shipping → Invoice.

**Architecture**: Self-hosted SvelteKit + Rust (Axum) binary. Shops download, run, own their data.

## Commands

All commands go through Moon. Never run raw `cargo`/`pnpm` directly unless debugging a failure.

```bash
moon run web:dev          # SvelteKit dev server
moon run web:build        # Build SvelteKit frontend (adapter-static)
moon run web:test         # Frontend tests (Vitest)
moon run web:check        # SvelteKit type-check (svelte-check)
moon run web:preview      # Preview production build
moon run api:dev          # Axum backend with auto-reload (depends on web:build)
moon run api:build        # Build Rust backend (depends on web:build)
moon run api:test         # Backend tests (cargo test)
moon run api:lint         # Clippy lints
moon run api:fmt          # Check Rust formatting (cargo fmt --check)
moon run api:fmt-write    # Apply Rust formatting (cargo fmt)
moon run api:gen-types    # Generate TypeScript from Rust structs (ts-rs)
moon run api:coverage     # Rust coverage report (JSON, used by CI)
moon run api:coverage-report  # Rust coverage report (HTML, local dev)
moon run api:smoke            # Hurl HTTP smoke tests (requires running server + hurl CLI)
moon run api:db-prepare   # Prepare SQLx offline cache (CI)
moon check --all          # Full CI: lint, test, typecheck, build across all projects
```

Underlying tools: `cargo` (Rust), `pnpm` (SvelteKit). Use directly only when diagnosing Moon task failures.

## Session Startup

- Code-modifying sessions use `claude --worktree` for automatic isolation
- If not launched with `--worktree`, use the `EnterWorktree` tool to create one before making changes
- **Never push to main directly** — always branch + PR
- **Commit+push after every logical chunk** — never leave work local-only
- **Update CHANGELOG.md** — add user-facing changes (`feat`, `fix`, `perf`) to the `## Unreleased` section in each PR
- **New API endpoints require a `.hurl` file** — add `tests/api/<domain>/<endpoint>.hurl` in the same PR. Error shape is `{"code": "...", "message": "...", "details": null}` — assert on `$.code`, not `$.error`
- Read-only sessions do not need a worktree

## Architecture

Clean Architecture — horizontal crate layers with vertical feature organization within each layer. Crate boundaries are **compiler-enforced**: if `crates/core` doesn't list `sea-orm` or `sqlx` in its `Cargo.toml`, domain code physically cannot import database or ORM types.

**Crate layers (horizontal):**
- `crates/core/` — domain logic, trait definitions (ports), business rules. No framework deps.
- `crates/db/` — SeaORM entities and repository implementations (adapters). SeaORM for entity CRUD, raw SQLx for complex/reporting queries. Implements traits from core.
- `crates/types/` — API DTOs and wire types with `#[derive(TS, Serialize)]`. No `DeriveEntityModel` or `FromRow` here — ORM types stay in `db/`. See ADR `adr-entity-type-placement.md`.
- `services/api/` — Axum handlers, middleware, routing. Thin layer over core services.
- `apps/web/` — SvelteKit UI. Consumes TypeScript types generated by ts-rs.

**Feature organization (vertical within each crate):**
```
crates/core/src/
  customer/
    mod.rs          # Customer type, CustomerId newtype
    traits.rs       # CustomerRepository trait (port)
    service.rs      # business logic (uses trait, not impl)
  quote/
    mod.rs
    traits.rs
    service.rs

crates/db/src/
  customer/
    entity.rs       # SeaORM entity (DeriveEntityModel)
    repo.rs         # SeaORM impl of CustomerRepository
  quote/
    entity.rs
    repo.rs

services/api/src/
  customer/
    handler.rs      # Axum routes, thin
  quote/
    handler.rs
```

Build features end-to-end as vertical slices (core/customer → db/customer → api/customer → web/customer), but the crate boundaries ensure domain logic stays portable — reusable in CLI tools, WASM modules, or future crates.

**Import rule**: `core` never imports from `db` or `api`. Dependencies flow inward.

## Coding Standards

1. **Rust newtypes for entity IDs** — `struct CustomerId(uuid::Uuid)`, not bare `String`. Never implement `Deref`/`DerefMut` on newtypes — use `.get()` for inner access, `From`/`Into` for conversion. Keep `sea-orm` and `sqlx` derives out of `crates/core/` and `crates/types/` — `DeriveEntityModel` and `FromRow` belong only in `crates/db/` on internal types. Domain entity structs live in `core/`, API DTOs in `types/`. See ADR `adr-entity-type-placement.md`.
2. **Financial arithmetic in Rust** — money types with fixed-point or integer-cents representation. Never floating-point for prices, totals, or tax.
3. **Hybrid ORM + raw SQL** — SeaORM for entity CRUD operations, `sqlx::query!()` / `sqlx::query_as!()` for complex joins, reporting, and aggregate queries. Never string-concatenated SQL in either approach.
4. **Svelte 5 runes only** — `$state`, `$derived`, `$effect`, `$props`. Never Svelte 4 stores or `export let`.
5. **Axum patterns** — standard Axum server setup, SQLite PRAGMAs (WAL, foreign_keys, busy_timeout), `thiserror` + `IntoResponse` error handling, repository traits with `Send + Sync` bounds.
6. **ts-rs type sharing** — API DTOs in `crates/types/` derive `TS` + `Serialize` for TypeScript generation. SeaORM entities in `crates/db/` derive `DeriveEntityModel` separately — they are infrastructure types, not shared. Run `moon run api:gen-types` to regenerate TypeScript bindings.
7. **Error handling** — `thiserror` for domain errors in `crates/core/`, custom `AppError` implementing `IntoResponse` in `services/api/`.
8. **No raw SQL injection** — parameterized queries only.
9. **URL state** — filters, search, pagination in URL query params. Svelte `$state` for ephemeral UI state only.
10. **Repository traits** — `async fn` in traits (Rust 1.75+, no `async-trait` crate). Traits in `crates/core/`, impls in `crates/db/` using SeaORM. Repo impls convert between SeaORM entities (`crates/db/`) and domain types (`crates/core/`). Bounds: `Send + Sync` only.
11. **SQLite `updated_at` triggers** — every mutable table gets an `AFTER UPDATE` trigger in its migration.
12. **Activity logging is part of the mutation contract, enforced by the adapter.** Entity repository adapters in `crates/db/` insert activity log entries within the same transaction as the mutation using the shared `insert_activity_log_raw()` helper. The service layer does not orchestrate logging — atomicity is guaranteed by the adapter. Future entity verticals (garment, quote, invoice) follow this same pattern: the `_raw` helper is `pub(crate)` within `crates/db/`, callable from any entity repo adapter.
13. **No sealed traits on internal crates** — crate boundaries provide sufficient encapsulation. Sealing blocks test doubles.
14. **SeaORM entity placement** — entities with `DeriveEntityModel` belong in `crates/db/` only, never in `crates/core/` or `crates/types/`. SeaORM entities are infrastructure types; domain types in `core/` remain ORM-free. Repository impls convert between the two.
15. **SeaORM migrations** — every migration must return `Some(true)` from `use_transaction()` (atomic SQLite migrations). Pre-migration backup is non-negotiable. `updated_at` triggers still required per item 11.
16. **Pre-implementation boundary checklist** — before writing any conditional, path-matching, or range-checking code, answer four questions: (a) What are the boundary values? (b) What happens *at* each boundary? (c) What is the "almost right" input that should be rejected? (d) How does the caller see a rejected input (error code, status, message)? Each answer should have a corresponding test. See `ops/standards/testing/negative-path.md`.

## Pre-Build Ritual

Before building any vertical: research → shaping → breadboarding → breadboard-reflection → implementation-planning → build → review.

## Deployment

```
session branches ──PR──→ main ──release──→ GitHub Releases (binary)
```

- **main** — integration branch. All PRs merge here.
- Releases are versioned binaries built from main.
- Never push directly to main.

## What NOT to Do

- No separate CSS files — Tailwind only
- No emoji icons — Lucide only
- No Svelte 4 patterns — runes only
- No `any` types in TypeScript — infer from ts-rs generated types
- No floating-point for money — Rust integer-cents or fixed-point
- No pushing to main directly
- No string-concatenated SQL — use SeaORM query builder or `sqlx::query!()` macros
- No hardcoded URLs — env vars or config only
- No bare primitive IDs — Rust newtypes for all entity identifiers
- No eslint — use `oxlint` for linting and `oxfmt` for formatting (OXC toolchain). Prettier only for `.svelte` files. Never install, configure, or run eslint.
- No SeaORM entities in `crates/core/` — entity structs with `DeriveEntityModel` are infrastructure types, not domain types
- No non-transactional SeaORM migrations — every migration must use `use_transaction() -> Some(true)`
- No caret/tilde version ranges on SeaORM RC — use exact pin `"=2.0.0-rc.37"` in Cargo.toml

Preserve:
- Current task objective, acceptance criteria, and the milestone being worked on
- File paths of all files currently being modified
- Most recent test/build output (pass/fail, error messages)
- Active branch name and worktree context
- Which domain (customers, garments, pricing, etc.) is being worked on

Discard:
- File contents from reads older than 5 tool calls
- Search results not acted on
- Reasoning traces from abandoned approaches
- Reference repo contents after patterns have been extracted
